	abstract = {Over the past decades, the demands placed on education systems have changed. Workers in the labour market need certain competences such as technical, methodological, social and personal competences. The aim of education today is to create a new educational paradigm that prepares the workforce of the future for the new challenges. This change is accompanied by the introduction of new didactic concepts such as blended learning, which combines the advantages of face-to-face and online learning with the use of digital teaching tools that can help develop the desired competences. The pandemic has led to a huge and rapid increase in the use of digital tools in education, which has necessitated the development of guidelines for their use. Therefore, the aim of this work is to present the digital tools that have been introduced into education and that require the development of digital competences by students and teachers, thus enabling teachers and managers of educational institutions to take advantage of the use of digital tools in the post-pandemic renewed situation.},
