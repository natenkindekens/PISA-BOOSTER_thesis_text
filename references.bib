	abstract = {Over the past decades, the demands placed on education systems have changed. Workers in the labour market need certain competences such as technical, methodological, social and personal competences. The aim of education today is to create a new educational paradigm that prepares the workforce of the future for the new challenges. This change is accompanied by the introduction of new didactic concepts such as blended learning, which combines the advantages of face-to-face and online learning with the use of digital teaching tools that can help develop the desired competences. The pandemic has led to a huge and rapid increase in the use of digital tools in education, which has necessitated the development of guidelines for their use. Therefore, the aim of this work is to present the digital tools that have been introduced into education and that require the development of digital competences by students and teachers, thus enabling teachers and managers of educational institutions to take advantage of the use of digital tools in the post-pandemic renewed situation.},

	abstract = {We review current debate regarding the core competencies that support early mathematics learning, focusing on the contributions of the inherent system for representing approximate magnitudes, and domain-general systems that facilitate learning across academic domains. The latter include the executive control system that enables explicit processing of quantitative symbols, such as Arabic numerals, and the logical problem-solving abilities (intelligence) that facilitate learning the relations among numerals. The neural systems that underlie these abilities, as related to mathematical learning, are also discussed, albeit briefly. We place the contributions of inherent quantitative abilities and domain-general mechanisms in an evolutionary context and provide some discussion as to how they interact during the learning of evolutionarily novel mathematics.},

	abstract = {This contribution reviewed the available evidence on the domain-specific and domain-general neurocognitive determinants of children's arithmetic development, other than nonsymbolic numerical magnitude processing, which might have been overemphasized as a core factor of individual differences in mathematics and dyscalculia. We focused on symbolic numerical magnitude processing, working memory, and phonological processing, as these determinants have been most researched and their roles in arithmetic can be predicted against the background of brain imaging data. Our review indicates that symbolic numerical magnitude processing is a major determinant of individual differences in arithmetic. Working memory, particularly the central executive, also plays a role in learning arithmetic, but its influence appears to be dependent on the learning stage and experience of children. The available evidence on phonological processing suggests that it plays a more subtle role in children's acquisition of arithmetic facts. Future longitudinal studies should investigate these factors in concert to understand their relative contribution as well as their mediating and moderating roles in children's arithmetic development.},
